<h1>Injection</h1>

<h2>What is injection?</h2>
<p>User input that is vulnerable and interpreted and carried out by the server. </p>

<h3>Why is this concept important?</h3> 
<p>If the vulnerable user input gets into the hands of the attacker, they can manipulate the user input. In other words, the data can be stolen, deleted, or modified. However, there are ways to mitigate an injection. Utilizing the newest frameworks, do a pen test, have a secure code review, and don't accept invalid and vulnerable user input.</p>
