<h1>Broken Access Control</h1>

<h2>What is broken access control?</h2>

<p> Users can view more information than authorized due to trust in the users or the client-side code. </p>

<h3>Why is this concept important?</h3> 
<p> When access control is broken, malicious users can disclose unauthorized information, modify information, or destroy all of the data due to vulnerabilities discovered in an application. Common vulnerability examples include IDOR, local file inclusion, weak authorization, and security through obscurity.</p>
