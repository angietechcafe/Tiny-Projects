<h1>Securing Networks</h1>

<h2>This note sheet is about securing network infrastructure.</h2>

<p>Here are the following ways to secure network infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Establish a performance baseline</li>
  <li>Symmetric Encryption Algorithms</li>
</ul>

<h3>Establish a performance baseline</h3>
<p>A performance baseline can be established by making a comparison with 
  the current performance so security professionals can discover performance issues.</p>
  
 <h3>Symmetric Encryption Algorithms: RC4 and Blowfish</h3>
 <p>Symmetric encryption algorithms utilize an identical key for encrypting and decrypting data. RC4 stands for Rivest Cipher 4. It is a stream cipher, meaning data is encrypted one byte at a time, blowfish is a block cipher that encrypts data in blocks, and blowfish is also encrypted at a particular time. </p>
