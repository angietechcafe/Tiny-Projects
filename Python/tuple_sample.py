# Goal: turn my fruit list into a tuple 
fruits = ["apple","orange","grape","strawberry","banana"]
# update the fruit list first by adding cherries.
fruits[3] = "cherries"
# use tuple() to create fruits list into a tuple.
tuple(fruits)
#output would be: apple, orange, grape, cherries, banana
# Make a mini tuple out of a tuple by slicing it with an index. Then print it out.
